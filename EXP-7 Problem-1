1. Remove Stones to Minimize the Total
Code:-
import heapq
class Solution:
    def minStoneSum(self, piles, k):
        max_heap = [-pile for pile in piles]
        heapq.heapify(max_heap)
        for _ in range(k):
            largest_pile = -heapq.heappop(max_heap)
            stones_to_remove = largest_pile // 2
            new_pile = largest_pile - stones_to_remove
            heapq.heappush(max_heap, -new_pile)
        total_remaining = -sum(max_heap)  
        return total_remaining
if __name__ == "__main__":
    solution = Solution()
    piles1 = [5, 4, 9]
    k1 = 2
    print(solution.minStoneSum(piles1, k1))  
    piles2 = [4, 3, 6, 7]
    k2 = 3
    print(solution.minStoneSum(piles2, k2))
